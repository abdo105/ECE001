<h2>C++ language</h2>
The c++ language has an object orientated shape that's utilized in massive initiatives. programmers can collaborate one application into one of a kind parts or maybe one character paintings on every part of the program. the structure of object orientated also permit code to be reused usually.this language is an efficient language. but, many programmers will disagree.
<h2>C Language</h2>
The c programming language is a  primary programming language and it is a completely popular language, particularly utilized in sport programming, due to the fact c language consists of the additional packing of the c++, each programmer makes use of this language as it makes packages quicker . however the price of this language gives the reusability of c++ to get the mild boom in performance with c programming language.
<h2>Pascal Language.</h2>
Pascal language is mostly a teaching language and few industries uses this language to write down the programs. this language has a tendency to apply key phrases instead of symbols and braces in interval. so this language is very clean for novices to apprehend than a programming language like c, c++. borland is a compiler software program corporation, which is the use of delphi programming language for industrial energy. delphi is an object oriented language of pascal, and presently  borland compilers handiest use it.

<h2>Fortran Language</h2>
Fortran language is a variety of crunching language and still it is utilized by scientists. this language lets in exclusive sizes of variables up to the memory limit in the device. this language is appropriate for engineers, who have to calculate values with excessive precision. application in fortran is rigid and every so often it makes difficult to study.

<h2>Java Language.</h2>
The java language is a multi platform language that’s particularly helpful in networking. of path, in general this language is used on the net with java applets. however, this language is used to layout cross platform applications, since it much like c++ in structure and syntax. for c++ programmers, java language is very smooth to research and it offers a few blessings supplied by using object oriented  programming. like reusability and it could be tough to write green code in java. however, nowadays thePace of the java language has increased and 1.5 version offers a few right capabilities for clean software making.

<h2>Perl Language.</h2>

Perl language is a report control language for unix. but it is extra popular for its not unusual gateway interface programming (cgi). it is a time period for packages that internet servers can perform to permit extra abilities of internet pages. pearl language is a way for looking textual content and it is used for useful server functions and different databases, and it is very clean to pick up the fundamentals when you have any revel in in any language. as a cgi language, web website hosting offerings pick out perl language overC++ language. because, the net hosts can evaluation perl script files. because they're textual content files, when c++ is compiled

<h2>PHP Language</h2>
</html>
The Hypertext Preprocessor language is used to layout net pages and every now and then it's also used as scripting language. this language is designed to broaden a speedy website, and as a result comprises features which make it easy generate http headers and link to databases. as a scripting language, it consists of a fixed of additives allow the programmer to without problems get up to hurry. however, it has more  state-of-the-art object orientated functions
<h2>LISP Language</h2>
Lisp language is mostly used in pc technological know-how studies and it shops all records in lists which include arrays. the syntax of listing is very simple and clean to make for developers to put into effect systems.
<h2>Scheme Language</h2>
The scheme language is an trade of lisp language, and it has a simpler syntax and functions. any venture beneath the scheme language will result in the re implementation of maximum of the  lisp language. but, that is very popular introductory language within the laptop technology department of mit’s. this language without problems solves the troubles as opposed to annoying about syntaxes of programming language.
